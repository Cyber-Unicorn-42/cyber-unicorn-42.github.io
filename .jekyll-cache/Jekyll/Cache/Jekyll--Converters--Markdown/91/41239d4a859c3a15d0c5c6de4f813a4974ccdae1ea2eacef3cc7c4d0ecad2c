I"7<p>We all know what a safe and secure password is right? It should have at least 8 characters, contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 numbers and 1 symbols, it should change regularly and you can reuse an arbitrary number of your previous passwords. But does this actually make passwords more secure?</p>
