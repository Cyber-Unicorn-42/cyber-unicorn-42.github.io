And while there are lots of smart people out there working on a passwordless future, it seems unlikely that we will ever truly go passwordless. There are multiple reasons for that, but the main reason is that we need some form of authentication that is 100% reliable. And by that I mean that it is not affected by outside factors (see the &lt;a href=&quot;#biometrics&quot;&gt;biometrics&lt;/a&gt; section for more details).
If I don’t believe we will ever go passwordless, how do we manage this ever increasing number of passwords while maintaining the best possible security posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools-and-strategies-for-managing-passwords&quot;&gt;Tools and strategies for managing passwords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways that we can manage this increasing number of passwords. I will go through a variety of tools and strategies below. I will start with those I think all of us should be using and work my way down to those that should be avoided at all costs.
And finally closing with some comments on items that do not relate directly to password management but are still very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-manager&quot;&gt;Password manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is the top recommendation I would give to anyone, stop trying to remember all your passwords and use a password manager. With a password manager you can create truly random and unique passwords of any length for each service you use, and you won’t even need to remember them. You will just need to remember a single password to get into your password manager. And because you only need to remember a single password you can make this password one that is difficult to guess but easy to remember. See &lt;a href=&quot;#passphrases&quot;&gt;my guidance below&lt;/a&gt; on how to make one of these passwords.
From my personal experience a good password manager needs a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It needs to be able to store your passwords in a way that makes it inaccessible to anyone but yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It also needs to be able to generate truly random passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It needs to be user friendly and convenient to use. This is not to be underestimated as a difficult to use application will just not get used.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It needs to be accessible from anywhere. With most of us using our mobile devices for a lot if not most of our online activities it is important you can also easily access the tool from any device.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to share some password securely between multiple people. This might not be as important when you are single, but once you have a family being able to share accounts, for say online shopping, makes a whole lot of sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have used and trialed most of the popular password managers both free and paid (&lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com/&quot;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lastpass.com/&quot;&gt;Lastpass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashlane.com&quot;&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://keepass.info/&quot;&gt;Keepass&lt;/a&gt; … ).
All of the password managers I have used served their purpose, these days I use 1Password and it is the one I would recommend. It is very user friendly, works across all devices and includes some great features (like being able to use it for multi factor authentication as well). And while 1Password is a paid solution it is a very worthwhile investment. At the time of this article the pricing was USD $2.99/month for a single user or USD $4.99/month for a “family” of 5. The time and effort that would be required to go through all the online services and reset the password already make it worthwhile. Plus the additional protection of a unique password per service means a compromise on 1 site will not affect any others.
Of that list there is only 1 I really would not recommend you use and that is Lastpass. While it is a capable password manager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/25/lastpass_android_trackers_found/&quot;&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; has discovered that it contains a large number of trackers. And while there is an opt-out functionality, the additional effort required to opt out as well as the significant limitations they imposed on their free tier users makes this manager a no go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biometrics&quot;&gt;Biometrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Password managers are great for all the online services, but you won’t be able to use the password manager until you get into the device it is installed on. And that device should also be as safe and secure as possible. One of the best ways to do this is to use biometrics. When I say biometrics I’m mainly talking about fingerprints and facial recognition (there are also other forms of biometrics like vein pattern or iris recognition but those are not generally available in consumer devices).
Biometrics not only increase the usability, in most cases they are also more secure than a password or passcode as they can’t be guessed.
That being said, all devices will still ask you to set up a passcode or password as a backup solution. The reason for this is that biometrics are not 100% reliable. There are numerous factors that can affect your biometrics e.g. if you have been in the water for some time your fingers will prune causing fingerprint sensors to stop working, facial recognition is dependent on the lighting conditions. In those situations, you still need to be able to access your device hence the backup passcode or password. In the next section I will cover what I do when I need to manually create a password that I need to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passphrases&quot;&gt;Passphrases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this option is to be avoided as much as possible, sometimes you have no choice but to manually create a password. There are some things you can do to create a password that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
Instead of using a password, I use a passphrase. What I mean by that is that I use a sentence and I write the sentence as one would normally write it along with capitalization and punctuation. The reason for using capitalization and punctuation is a that lot of places still use outdated password policies (see my &lt;a href=&quot;\password-policies.html&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; for more on that).
The choice of sentence to use is an important one as it needs to be something that is not easily guessed. The strategy I use is to find an uncommon event that happened in my life recently and that is reasonably uncommon e.g. “My son threw a ball that hit me in the face.”. Choosing common events that might apply to lots of people would over time make the passphrase less secure as it would become known when there are data breaches in the future that would include that sentence. An example of a bad passphrase would be “It was sunny outside” or in the current pandemic “I had to start homeschooling.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-use-the-same-password&quot;&gt;Re-use the same password&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be avoided at all costs. At no point should you have multiple services or devices that use the same password, even if you attach very little value to the service you put those passwords on. If you are using the tools and strategies above you will only have to remember a handful of passwords (1 for your password manager and 1 for each device you use).
Even if the service you have is on a device that doesn’t support having a password manager (e.g. gaming consoles) you can open the password manager on your phone and view the password there. While it might be painful most of these devices will have an option to remember the password which I would recommend using instead of choosing a simple password that was re-used. The reason being that most of these services also have portals accessible through web browsers and the devices you are saving the password on are generally not portable and stay inside your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-factor-authentication&quot;&gt;Multi-Factor Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that you should enable on every service it is possible. And while it does not help with the managing of your passwords, it does make it harder for someone to access any of your accounts even if they manage to get a hold of your account.
The preferred method of multi-factor authentication would be app-based. App-based MFA is not as easily intercepted as SMS based MFA.
In general terms to intercept app-based MFA someone would need access to your device or have compromised the device. With SMS based MFA they can have your number ported or redirected by your carrier without needing more than some of your “personal” details.
SMS based MFA is still better than no MFA, but if you have the option of using app-based MFA, you should use that.
Another advantage of app-based MFA is that some password managers can act as the app that provides the MFA. They can scan the QR code shown on your screen and act much the same way as the app would. The added benefit is that you won’t need to manually type in or copy in the code, the password manager will fill it for you automatically or with a click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has given you some useful information on how you can manage all those passwords and do all you can to keep them as safe and secure as possible. If you think something is missing or have any other comments please reach out to me and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Peter Dodemont</name></author><category term="Security" /><category term="Passwords" /><category term="Personal" /><summary type="html">Most of us are having to deal with an ever increasing number of passwords in our lives.

It should have at least 8 characters, contain at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number and 1 symbol, it should change regularly and you can reuse an arbitrary number of your previous passwords. But does this actually make passwords more secure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-current-password-policies-dont-work&quot;&gt;Why the current password policies don’t work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down each of the rules that are commonly in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-should-be-at-least-8-characters&quot;&gt;Passwords should be at least 8 characters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is actually not bad. 8 characters gives quite a wide variety of possible combinations. Longer is better but 8 is generally enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-should-be-complex-ie-1-uppercase-1-lowercase-1-number-and-1-symbol&quot;&gt;Passwords should be complex i.e. 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number and 1 symbol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rule has been proven over and over again to not work. The reason for this is fairly simple, we all substitute the same characters. And why do we all replace the same characters because they are visually very close. We also tend to fall back on things we already know, so most will put a capital at the start and a punctuation at the end.
Let’s take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/936/&quot;&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt; “correct horse battery staple”. If you were to ask random people to make this “secure” you will find  that they will do one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capital the C of correct&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capital the first letter of each word&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add a exclamation mark or dot at the end&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the o’s with 0’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the s’s with 5’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the e’s with 3’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the a’s with 4’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we are not as clever as we think we are. We all have the same ideas. Malicious actors are well aware of these substitutions and as such will also do the same substitutions when attempting to guess passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-should-be-changed-regularly&quot;&gt;Passwords should be changed regularly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just with the complexity rule, password expiry has been proven over and over to not work. Most people will simply add a number to the end or beginning of their password and then just adjust the number when it comes time to change your password. And again there are a few very common strategies people use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increment the number by 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the number of the month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the number of the month plus the year (either 2 or 4 digits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again these strategies are very trivial for a malicious actor to account for. If they manage to get a hold of one of your passwords (e.g. through a data breach) they will notice the number and will be able to work out the pattern pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-should-be-different-from-previous-passwords&quot;&gt;Passwords should be different from previous passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I described in the previous point the most common strategy is to adjust a number at the end or beginning to change your password. This doesn’t really constitute changing the password as a malicious actor can easily see the pattern and now only needs to guess 1  character (or at maximum a few characters) of the password. This might give someone a false sense of security that their password is safe when in reality it is likely less secure than if it was never changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-do-instead&quot;&gt;What should I do instead?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there has been lots of research in this area. And my recommendations below are based on what all that research says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-should-be-at-least-8-characters-1&quot;&gt;Passwords should be at least 8 characters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted before this is a pretty good rule. Research done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations?view=o365-worldwide#requiring-long-passwords&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has shown that when passwords get too long users will start using repeating patterns. These long passwords would be easier to guess than shorter passwords that do not repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-dont-need-any-complexity&quot;&gt;Passwords don’t need any complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most of us employ the same substitution techniques, complexity serves no real purpose. It doesn’t make the passwords any harder to guess, but it does make them harder to remember. This is cited in virtually all current password guidance documents from entities that have done password research. NIST notes the below in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#appA&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;composition rules are commonly used in an attempt to increase the difficulty of guessing user-chosen passwords. Research has shown, however, that users respond in very predictable ways to the requirements imposed by composition rules. For example, a user that might have chosen “password” as their password would be relatively likely to choose “Password1” if required to include an uppercase letter and a number, or “Password1!” if a symbol is also required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and the NCSC also make similar remarks in their guidance which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations?view=o365-worldwide#requiring-the-use-of-multiple-character-sets&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach#tip5-password-collection&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;passwords-do-not-need-to-expire-regularly&quot;&gt;Passwords do not need to expire regularly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we saw previously users do not change their whole password when they are forced to change it. This can give a false sense of security that the password is safe even if there has been a data breach because it was changed recently. The reality is that the new password is less secure as it can easily be guessed. The password &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach#tip5-password-collection&quot;&gt;guidance from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words and numbers which are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous password. Password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because cyber criminals almost always use credentials as soon as they compromise them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCSC provides very similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach#tip4-password-collection&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-banned-password-lists&quot;&gt;Use banned password lists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than enforcing arbitrary rules on password you should be using a list of passwords users cannot use. This list of banned passwords should include a corpus of previous breached passwords as will as any words that refer back to the business or website that users are setting their password for. For example if your company name was Security Pete and you were based out of Sydney Australia, you would also ban the use of the words “security”, “pete”, “sydney” and “australia”. These words would be easily guessable if they were used in a password. Microsoft even considers this to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/misc/password-policy-recommendations?view=o365-worldwide#ban-common-passwords&quot;&gt;the most important&lt;/a&gt; requirement for passwords:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most important password requirement you should put on your users when creating passwords is to ban the use of common passwords to reduce your organization’s susceptibility to brute force password attacks. Common user passwords include: abcdefg, password, monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIST offers a similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#appA&quot;&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;only-change-passwords-when-they-are-suspected-to-have-been-compromised&quot;&gt;Only change Passwords when they are suspected to have been compromised&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no direct mention of password history in any of the guidance. Common sense dictates that if your password never expires you will not have to force the password to be different to previous passwords. What you should instead be doing is monitoring new data breaches and comparing the passwords in those data breaches to the passwords of your users. If a user has been found to have a password that is the same as in the data breach you should force a password change onto the user. &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I been pwned&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent free service you can use for checking if passwords or users were in a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-multi-factor-authentication&quot;&gt;Use Multi-factor Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not directly a password policy, it is an integral part in the password lifecycle. Using multi-factor authentication gives you additional security even when the user’s password has been compromised. And gives you the ability to verify a users identity when asking the users to perform a password reset.
From personal experience having to provide multi-factor authentication every single time you authenticate becomes extremely time-consuming especially if it happens multiple times in a day. As such I recommend implementing risk based multi-factor authentication. Risk based multi-factor authentication uses a number of factors from the user’s session as the additional factors rather than prompting the user for the additional factor. It only prompts the user for the additional factor if the session factors indicate the user or the session is high risk. These session factors generally include things like time of the day, current location, is it physically possible for the user to have travelled between their previous location and their current location, are they anonymized (e.g. Tor browser, VPN) …
While risk based authentication does not provide the same level of security as prompting the user for a factor each time, it improves security significantly while also reducing user friction significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations I put forward here should be implemented together. If you chop and change between them you run the risk of actually reducing the security of the passwords instead of improving them.
I have referenced Microsoft, NIST and NCSC a few times through this post and I will post the links to their respective guidance pages below once again. I do suggest you read through them all as they contain a lot more valuable information than what I have included in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
