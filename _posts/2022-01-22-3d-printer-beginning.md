3D printing is a fascinating hobby to get started with right now. There are just enough people into 3D printing that you can get one quite easily and relatively cheap. But it has not progressed to a point where everything has been perfected yet and there is no more real discovery or sense of accomplishment when you print that nearly perfect print you have worked on for so long.

## The Journey Begins
I bought my 3D printer many years ago when a local supermarket (ALDI) was selling a Wanhao i3 plus clone called a Cocoon Create Touch.
![Cocoon Create Touch 3D Printer](/assets/img/posts/2022-01-22-3d-printer-beginning/cocoon-create-touch.png "Cocoon Create Touch 3D Printer") They had sold them before, but I didn't want to get started with 3D printing at that time, so I wasn't even aware they sold them. ALDI is known to sell good quality items at steep discounts from time to time in their weekly special buys. These items are usually very limited in stock and regularly lead to, let's call them, altercations at their stores. While the printers aren't quite at that level, they are usually gone within the first day or so of being available. I was unable to make it to a store on the first or even the second day, so I had resorted to not being able to get one. But since live in an area that is under heavy development with suburbs that are only partially filled, and generally cash poor people because they just build or bought a new house, I decided to try my luck when I happened to be in the area of one of the stores. It's good that I did as they still had 1 in stock, which I bought along with some additional filament (this is what is used as a base material for printing).
Even though I managed to get that printer, life got in the way, and I ended up living in a number of places I knew weren't going to be long term. In the end it would take a few years for me actually unbox the printer and start printing, which I finally did last year.

## Test Prints
Getting everything out of the box and getting it setup where really exciting after having carted it around from place to place for a number of years. I had a perfect spot for it next to my desk, so I made a custom table for it to sit on.

First thing to do after setting up the 3D printer is leveling the bed. This was quite an annoying process to go through as it involves sliding a piece of paper on the print bed (the bottom plate), between it and the nozzle. You then need to adjust some screws which in turn losses or tightens sone springs to ensure that the piece of paper slides with just a tiny bit of friction between the nozzle and the bed.
Once done I kicked off some test prints that came with preloaded on the SD card of the printer (more on that later). First a "2D" rocket ship followed by a 3D rocket ship in several parts. The 2D rocket came out great, then I started on the 3D rocket and the sample filament what was in the box ran out before it finished. But since I wasn't watching the print (as they take quite a while), I didn't notice until quite a while later.

(I did end up finding a use for the half-finished rocket body, I use it to hold any sauce bottle upside down when they are nearly empty, so not a total waste :) )

## First Prints
After the test prints came out great, I decided to try and print some other things. One of my friends who got into 3D printing before me (he was the one who go me onto it in the first place), told me about [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/). Thingiverse is a website where people upload their creation for you to download and print for free. So, I decided to go there and look for something cool to print. Thingiverse is loaded with many thousands of creations, some are great, and some are terrible (as is the case with any site people put up stuff for free). I decided I would try and find a model of a velociraptor as my son was really into dinosaurs at the time. I came across the [Flexi Raptor](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2901355) which I thought was really cool. It reminded me of an [Octopus](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3495390) my friend had shown me (which I also ended up printing a bunch of later).
These 2 items showcase something that is really cool about 3D printers, namely that you can print very intricate designs with moving parts that won't require any assembly. These are items you print in one go and when you take them off the print bed they have all these articulations. No assembly also means there are no weak point where the parts slot together.
The process of printing these is pretty straight forward, you download an STL file which contains the model of the item you want to print. You then import that model into what is called a slicer program. The slicer program translates the model into commands that your printer can understand (these are called gcodes). There are numerous slicer programs out there and there is plenty of information on how to set these up exactly. But it usually comes down to a few simple steps, after having installed the program, you need to tell it details about your printer (e.g. how high, wide and long it is). You can do this all yourself, but unless you have a really obscure printer or you have made one yourself (which if you have, you are probably not reading this article), the community will already have done this for you and you can import/copy the settings. You then need to determine the different settings for your print and printer. There are many settings you can adjust, but again at the start you can just lean on what comes included with the slicer programs as these are tried and tested to provide pretty good quality prints on the most printers. And finally, you slice the model you loaded and save it onto an SD card that you can then insert in the printer and print.

## OctoPrint
After having done a few prints, I was really getting over the fact that I needed to load files onto an SD card and then insert and remove the SD card from my PC and printer. This is the point where I came across [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/). OctoPrint is an open-source application that allows you to control and monitor your prints and printer. Most importantly for me, it provides a web interface where you can load your gcode files and then send them to the printer. The method it connects to the printer varies, but in my case, it uses a USB port on the printer that is provided exactly for this purpose. This means no more fiddling with SD cards and but instead I have a nice and easy to use web interface. There are many modules that can be added to OctoPrint to a variety of things (e.g. more detailed statistics, turning power on or off, taking pictures of your print while in progress) I won't cover any of these, just know there are many things you can do with OctoPrint.
OctoPrint will run on a variety of OS's and devices, the most common one is running it on a Raspberry Pi, because it is small and cheap. I won't go into detail on how to install OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi as there is a excellent manual already available on the OctoPrint website right [here](https://octoprint.org/download/).

## BLTouch
After having done a number of prints I started running into some problems with my prints failing because they weren't sticking to the print bed properly, this mostly happened with larger items. After a bit of research, I found that the issue would most likely be due to my bed not being level. You might recall that I performed the bed leveling when got the printer out of the box. It appears that for the best results you should level your bed before every print. Now this would be a massive hassle as it takes quite a while to do. While doing the research I also noticed lots of people were mentioning that the bed itself might not be perfectly level either, especially for the cheaper end of the 3D printers (which my printer was firmly in).
So I started looking into a better way to do the bed levelling, which brought me to automatic bed levelling. This is something you will find on more expensive 3D printers by default, but not on the cheaper ones. Luckily for me there was a solution, something called a [BLTouch](https://www.antclabs.com/bltouch). The BLtouch is sensor developed by Antclabs that can be added to most 3D printers to give it automatic bed levelling.
This is the point where I firmly realized that 3D printing is not yet ready for your average consumer. The manual levelling is way too cumbersome to do at every print and getting automatic leveling on a "cheap" printer means installing an additional sensor that requires you to take apart the 3D printer, do some soldering and load custom firmware onto the printer. Those last 2 are firmly outside the comfort zone of most people, even taking the printer apart is probably something most consumer wouldn't do.
I won't go into detail about the installation process of the BLTouch as it is specific to each printer, and there are some really good resources out there already, like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHstALf8Feo) from the Teaching Tech Youtube channel that I used for the model of printer I have.
I also will not go into detail on the custom firmware as again this is something that will depend on your printer. The one I use is called ADVi3++ which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrivet/ADVi3pp) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=6504486) depending on if you are comfortable with building it yourself from source or not. ADVi3++ also has guides available for the installation of the firmware and the BLTouch. Some are free, but for some you will need to become a Patreon to get access.
Below is a video of the BLtouch in action on my printer.

This is where I will finish up this article on my first steps into the world of 3D printing. There are more articles to come with lessons I have learned since I took these first steps and further upgrades I have added.
