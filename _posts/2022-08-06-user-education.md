I'd like to tell you about THE solution to all your security problems, user education. Once your users have completed their user education you will be safe from any attack for the next year, because we all know that after a year your user will suddenly forget all about the training and have to do it all over again.  
The above statement (while exaggerated) I hope makes it clear how absurd the current process of user education at the majority of businesses is. So let's explore what is being done currently and the effect it's having. And let's also explore some of the new ways that are being developed.

At this stage, most people have had to go through numerous of these security education programs and have gotten the result pictured below.

Yet most compromises still happen because a user clicked, downloaded, and/or ran something they shouldn't. To me, this indicates that the current way most user education is done is not working. There are numerous reasons why this might be the case, so let's explore what I believe are the 3 most impactful. 
### Training Method

Intuitively most people understand that not everyone learns the same way, yet for our user education and awareness program we mostly just give everyone the exact same style, a course they have to sit through and complete. For some people this probably works, for others (like myself) a more interactive course would be more effective, or how about a security education game or maybe something in song works better. So rather than have a "one-size-fits-all" approach offering a variety of options for security education will not only improve its effectiveness but also stop it from being a chore for people to complete.  
There are numerous options out there, here is a video of a song Rachel Tobac did on password security for example

And here is a quick selection of some non-traditional ones from a quick search I did just now.

### Frequency

Probably the most common frequency out there is doing the user education once a year. I would guess this is probably too long of an interval for most people to effectively remember what they learned. Can you remember what you did a year ago at work? I know I can't. I started this blog about a year and in my very first post I used a list, so this should mean that I remember how to make a list in Markdown (which is what I use for formatting my blog posts), but I don't I had to refer back to my first post. So as you can see, remembering something from a year ago isn't likely to work.  
Another option is ongoing user education. You could for example have a percentage of the links that users click in email be redirected to a page that asks them if the link is safe or malicious (some secure email gateways offer this). This can have the opposite effect though if the links the user is presented with, are always safe, a user might begin to assume that any link they receive is going to be safe.  
Just like with the method, I believe that you cannot have a single frequency across the business, some users will require more training than others. The best course of action is to monitor and log when a user might click on a malicious link and adjust the frequency of training accordingly on a per-user basis.
### Incentive

Incentivising users to do their training can be very challenging, traditionally the method depicted below is used.

Threatening the users with some negative consequences for not completing the training might be effective in getting them to do it, but is it the best way to get them engaged? I would say it isn't, as they are really only completing the training to avoid the negative consequence.  
Drawing on my personal experience, raising my son and teaching/training people over the years, rewarding is a much more effective teaching method.

There is a myriad of behaviors and rewards you can look at, some of the rewards might be:
- Cash prize (as in the picture above)
- Positive feedback on annual performance review
- A team outing
And some of the behaviors could be:
- Least amount of malicious links clicked in a month/quarter/year
- Most true positive reports of malicious emails
- Improvements to processes that improve security
If you are going to look at behaviors that measure something (like the number of links clicked), you need to make sure you can measure it in a consistent and repeatable way to make sure it is fair for all your users.

I hope that this article has given you some useful new insights into user education. If there is something you believe I missed or that is incorrect, or if you don't agree please reach out. I'm definitely not all-knowing, and there is always more I can learn.
